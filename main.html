		<p>Tell me a stereotype and I’ll show you how to break them." Revolution they
			call it, but we would just like to keep it as our need to simplify stylish.
			Oxfords were too formal, Derby joined them too and Brogues, well they 
			were just too dressy for a weekday date night. Moccasins stepped in to 
			save the day, and we enhanced the look further like any fashion monger
			would do. We didn’t make our place in a day but we made it strong, 
			slowly and eventually. We emerged from Norway, rolled our way across 
			Europe before becoming the American classic, and here we are—breaking 
			the stereotypes in India. On one day we redefine formal in an award-function
			, on another we dress with a pair of shorts for a beach shack date; 
			we dress down for the evening and dress up for the brunch; we are 
			preppy but also punk, and so we fit everywhere. Thus, leather loafers 
			for men occupy a safe space as the go-to option that sits in every fine
			wardrobe.
